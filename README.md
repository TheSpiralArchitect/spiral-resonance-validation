# Spiral Resonance Law (SRL) — Validation Suite

**Author:** Jake Patterson  
**Repository Purpose:**  
This repository contains the full validation suite for the **Spiral Resonance Law (SRL)** — a scalar field model that predicts spiral-aligned structure across both cosmic datasets (quasars, CMB) and symbolic systems (synthetic streams, EEG, etc).

SRL hypothesizes that a scalar field of the form:

\[
\Phi(r, \theta) = A \cos(\omega \log r + n \theta)
\]

drives the emergence of spiral structures at multiple scales. This repository provides tools to reproduce, extend, and test this hypothesis.
